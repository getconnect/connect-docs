# Querying events

Currently, this SDK does not support querying events.  However, you have the following options to query:

* [**HTTP API**](http.html#querying-events) - send queries and receives results directly via JSON
* [**JavaScript SDK**](js.html#querying-events) - query events and build visualizations client-side in the browser
* [**.NET SDK**](net.html#querying-events) - query events using the fluent .NET query syntax

We're really looking forward to supporting querying in all SDKs soon!
